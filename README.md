# Traffic Sign Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project is a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for traffic sign recognition. It includes the following components:

1. Data Preparation: Unzipping the dataset, loading images, and preprocessing.

2. Data Augmentation: Applying data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data.

3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: Building and training a CNN model for traffic sign recognition.

4. Model Evaluation: Testing the trained model on a test dataset and reporting accuracy.
