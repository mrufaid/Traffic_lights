# Traffic Sign Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project is a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for traffic sign recognition. It includes the following components:

1. Data Preparation: Unzipping the dataset, loading images, and preprocessing.

2. Data Augmentation: Applying data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data.

3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: Building and training a CNN model for traffic sign recognition.

4. Model Evaluation: Testing the trained model on a test dataset and reporting accuracy.

## Getting Started

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle: [Traffic Sign Dataset Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahemateja19bec1025/traffic-sign-dataset-classification/data).


## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed as in requirements.txt

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
Run the my_project.py file:

```bash
python my_project.py
```
The script will perform data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

Trained model weights will be saved as `my_model.h10`.


## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 82.54% on the test dataset.
